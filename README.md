# MovieHubBackend
This is the backend for a website called Moviehub that allows users to review movies and tv shows. This is a student project for Java Web Programing. <br>
<p>To see the frontend of the project visit https://github.com/Futurespast/MovieHubFrontend </p>

<p> In order to run the website you'll need to have both the fronend and back and code. You'll need to run both in the IDE and you'll have to make sure the api is running on Port 8080.</p>

<p> I wasn't able to get the edit review to work so that's something that I would like to have implemented in the future. Another thing to improve upon is the visual look of the website. There's probably other quality of life improvements that could be implemented. </p>

To find a detailed explanation of api and the backend please refer to the read me file of this repository: https://github.com/Futurespast/MovieHubBackend
